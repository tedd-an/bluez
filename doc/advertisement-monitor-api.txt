BlueZ D-Bus Advertisement Monitor API Description
*************************************************

This API allows an client to specify a job of monitoring advertisements by
registering the root of hierarchy and then exposing advertisement monitors
under the root with filtering conditions, thresholds of RSSI and timers
of RSSI thresholds.

Once a monitoring job is activated by BlueZ, the client can expect to get
notified on the targeted advertisements no matter if there is an ongoing
discovery session (a discovery session is started/stopped with methods in
org.bluez.Adapter1 interface).

Advertisement Monitor hierarchy
===============================
Service		org.bluez
Interface	org.bluez.AdvertisementMonitor1
Object path	freely definable

Methods		void Release() [noreply]

			This gets called as a signal for a client to perform
			clean-up when (1)a monitor cannot be activated after it
			was exposed or (2)a monitor has been deactivated.

		void Activate() [noreply]

			After a monitor was exposed, this gets called as a
			signal for client to get acknowledged when a monitor
			has been activated, so the client can expect to receive
			calls on DeviceFound() or DeviceLost().

		void DeviceFound(object device) [noreply]

			This gets called to notify the client of finding the
			targeted device. Once receiving the call, the client
			should start to monitor the corresponding device to
			retrieve the changes on RSSI and advertisement content.

		void DeviceLost(object device) [noreply]

			This gets called to notify the client of losing the
			targeted device. Once receiving this call, the client
			should stop monitoring the corresponding device.

Properties	uint8 Type [read-only]

			The type of a monitor can be the following values. More
			will be added.
			0x01 - Patterns with logic OR applied
				Supported only if "patterns-with-logic-or-
				applied" is supported.

		(Int16, Uint16, Int16, Uint16) RSSIThreshholdsAndTimers [read-only, optional]

			This contains HighRSSIThreshold, HighRSSIThresholdTimer,
			LowRSSIThreshold, LowRSSIThresholdTimer in order. The
			unit of HighRSSIThreshold and LowRSSIThreshold is dBm.
			The unit of HighRSSIThresholdTimer and
			LowRSSIThresholdTimer is second.

			If these are provided, RSSI would be used as a factor to
			notify the client of whether a device stays in range or
			move out of range. A device is considered in-range when
			the RSSIs of the received advertisement(s) during
			HighRSSIThresholdTimer seconds exceed HighRSSIThreshold.
			Likewise, a device is considered out-of-range when the
			RSSIs of the received advertisement(s) during
			LowRSSIThresholdTimer do not reach LowRSSIThreshold.

		array{(uint8, uint8, string)} Patterns [read-only, optional]

			If Type is set to 0x01, this must exist and has at least
			one entry in the array.

			The structure of a pattern contains the following.
			uint8 start_position
				The index in an AD data field where the search
				should start. The beginning of an AD data field
				is index 0.
			uint8 AD_data_type
				See https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/
				assigned-numbers/generic-access-profile/ for
				the possible allowed value.
			string content_of_pattern
				This is the value of the pattern.

=======================================
Service		org.bluez
Interface	org.bluez.AdvertisementMonitorManager1
Object path	/org/bluez/{hci0,hci1,...}
Methods		void RegisterApplication(object application)

			This registers a hierarchy of advertisement monitors.
			The application object path together with the D-Bus
			system bus connection ID define the identification of
			the application registering advertisement monitors.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.AlreadyExists

		void UnregisterApplication(object application)

			This unregisters advertisement monitors that have been
			previously registered. The object path parameter must
			match the same value that has been used on
			registration.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.DoesNotExist

Properties	array{string} SupportedFeatures [read-only]

			This reflects the supported features of advertisement
			monitoring. An application should check this before
			instantiate and expose an object of
			org.bluez.AdvertisementMonitor1.

			Here are the potential features. More will be added.
			software-based-filtering
				The filtering process is mainly done in BlueZ.
			patterns-with-logic-or-applied
				Logic OR would be applied among the patterns
				provided by a monitor object.
			rssi-monitoring
				Values of RSSIThreshholdsAndTimers would be
				applied during the filtering process.
